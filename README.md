## How it works (ranking)

Uses a precomputed similarity matrix (similarity.pkl) over movies (movie_dic.pkl).
When you pick a movie, we sort by its row in that matrix (highest first).
The gold stars are a min-max remap of similarity to 0â€“5 for the displayed set (not IMDb ratings).
TMDB is used only to fetch posters.
